## Day 18

### Date: 6/29/2023

#### Tasks Accomplished

- Tried getting more familiar with Langchain

#### Things I Learned

- Got to know more about different methods and their uses 

#### Thoughts/Questions/Ideas
-Including FAQs can help with efficiency and user experience 
- When users are interacting with chatbots having FAQs can help them find answers quickly and reduce the number of lengthy conversations with the bot
- FAQs have answers to many common concerns or questions users may have. Having an FAQ section can help users scroll through to find solutions themselves without needing much assistance from the bot since it is very likely what they're looking for is going to be in the FAQ.
- Also..by analyzing user interactions, new frequently asked questions can be identified, making it more effective and efficient
- Besides just having normal conversations I think that it is very important that chatbots recognize when human assistance is needed. Sometimes some concerns could have a solution that may not be provided by a chatbot..being able to recognize that and recommend human help for further assistance could be very useful in my opinion

---
## Day 21

### Date: 7/2/2023

#### Tasks Accomplished
- Looked over the format and organization of some websites online 

#### Things I Learned


#### Thoughts/Questions/Ideas
- My answer to the question 'Why should a retail website use a chatbot on their website' has changed a little bit. At first, I mainly thought about the quick access to assistance..I didn't think much about the idea of chatbots analyzing conversations to help with certain suggestions. If retail companies use a chatbot that analyzes conversations and gives responses accordingly it will be more efficient overall for the user because the answers they will get will be more accurate.

- If a chatbot does more than just talk to the user.. customer satisfaction will be better. For example, if a chatbot receives input on preferences from a user..the chatbot can suggest a product based on those preferences. This will provide the user with a product that they will be satisfied with since it most likely matches their choice.
